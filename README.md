# Dual N-Back

A simple browser-based dual n-back game that trains working memory using color and position stimuli. Future audio functionality can be added via the placeholder in the JavaScript code.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser. Choose an `N` value and press **Start** to begin. Press **J** when the position of the square matches the one `N` steps earlier, and press **F** when the color matches `N` steps earlier.

No server setup is required.
